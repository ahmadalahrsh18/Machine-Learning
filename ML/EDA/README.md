# Student Performance EDA

This is a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that analyzes the performance of students in a fictional school. The dataset contains information about various attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, test scores, etc. This project aims to provide insights into the factors that affect student performance.


The repository contains the following files:

- `eda-students-performance-in-exams.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the EDA.
- `StudentsPerformance.csv`: The dataset used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


## Running the EDA

To run the EDA, simply open the `eda-students-performance-in-exams.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all the cells.
